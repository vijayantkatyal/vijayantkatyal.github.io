from past few weeks, i am working on a side project [SVG bits](https://vijayantkatyal.com/svg-bits/)

<br>

### Need ?

i prefer using svg icons wherever i can (using as icons in web application, designing interfaces in Adobe Illustrator) instead of icon fonts. you can [compare both here](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/).

but can't find any good app to view, search, and convert svg icons in windows. so i made it myself. it's open source and built on [electron](electron.atom.io).

<br>

### Features

* Folders
  * Add and Manage multiple svg (icons) folders
  * search icons in selected folder

* Color picker to change svg icon colors (preview in real time)

* Automatic Updates (windows version) - on new release, app will notify and install new update. 

* switch b/w designer and developer mode

* Developer Mode
  * drag-and-drop icons to code editors (e.g. sublime text editor) (if editor doesn't support drag-drop text e.g. visual studio code, can insert/place code using past command i.e. ctrl+v)
  * format icon to different programming languages (currently by default svg optimized code is generated)

* Designer Mode
  * drag-and-drop icons to design apps (e.g. adobe illustrator, inkscape)

<br>

### Features in Upcoming Releases

* search svg icons & packages (open source) within app (like package manager but for svg icons)
* add new code output formats
