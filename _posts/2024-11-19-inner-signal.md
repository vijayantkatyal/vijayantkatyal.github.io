> don't just react to what's happending around you or how everyone is reacting, but become self-aware and curious on why it happen.

for example when you are standing at a traffic signal
- you will move your vehicle when everyone starts moving or
- you will stare at the traffic signal and will prepare when it's about to turn green.


same goes for life,

but in case of life we don't have a traffic signal which will guide us.

so we create own inner "signal" by observing patterns, staying curious and make it better through our experience.

which will help us make better decisions.
